# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Early detection of heart disease can save lives. This project leverages classical machine‑learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on a set of clinical and demographic attributes drawn from the UCI Heart Disease dataset

## 📌 Dataset
- Source: (www.kaggle.com) UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Target: `num` column (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Pickle (for saving model)

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Encoding (Label & Ordinal)
3. EDA (Visualizations)
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Exported final model as `model.pkl`
